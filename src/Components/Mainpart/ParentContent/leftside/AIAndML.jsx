      <h3>
        Already taken AI/ML(4.0 Technology) in college. So I don’t think to join
        in CCBP 4.0
      </h3>

      <pre>{`   
      Understand the core concern. If their core resistance is already learning 4.0 technology in college,
      So why CCBP? then you can continue with below
    
     <Acknowledge> Many people think like you only, there is nothing wrong.
    
    1. Yes, almost all college these days have introduced specialisation, but there is one thing we need 
       to understand -

    2. **Also if most students in college are having these specialisations, everyone should get 12L, 15L 
       and 20L+ salaries right?**

        1. **But, more than 90% of students are settling for 4L, 5L salaries.**

        2. **<Depending on college> 90%, 100% placements are happening but how are the packages?**

    3. **Where is the gap? Why are not all students getting high paid jobs?**

        1. Out of 40 subjects, these specialisations are just one or 2 subjects in 2nd year or 3 year.

        2. Semester breakdown (6 months → 60 hours)

        3. Depth of learning is missing, students will hardly learn when it is just a subject in college

        4. Projects and practical skills are missing

            1. I am sending you some projects

        5. Who are trainers in college? same old teachers right.

        6. But in CCBP, it is product developers, people who worked in top companies are training

    4. Continue with other key points like 2000+ companies, **reverse engineered**, interview training etc
    
    5. Whatever is missing in college, we are come up with a solution for them.`}</pre>
