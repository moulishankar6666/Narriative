        {`
    - That’s great, so what kind of govt. job do you want to do? <UPSC, PSU, RRB etc.>

    - Yes few students tell me they want to do a govt job, either they want to do it because they want 
      to bring an impact in the country or for money, stability, etc.

    <Understand the core reason>

    - If Stability, Money, Status

        - Why do you feel there is less stability in the private jobs? <Acknowledge & Address>

        - Lets take an example - Can you tell me what’s your household expenses per month (20k, 25k, 40k)

        - And what is the starting salary of a government job? (18k - 30k)

        - Okay so after so much of hard work we’re earning only 20-30k per month, but since it’s secure 
          we’re fine with it

        - But lets say if you do a private job where you’re earning 1.5-2L per month, how much would 
          be the savings per month? 1L and above?

        - So with those saving even if something big like covid comes, how many months can you survive 
          without having a job? (Easily 1 year)

        - If there is a way, where you have more chances to reach your goal (Stability, Money, Status)
          would you like to explore?

    - If Want to do something for the country

        - Did you want to something for the country that’s why you chose UPSC/other govt. jobs?

        - Every year how many students give these exams (10-15 Lakh)

        - How many of them appear with the strong intent to serve the nation? (50-60% of them)

        - But how many eventually clear and get that job? (1%)
        
        - So what happens to the remaining student who have the strong passion to do something for
          the country?

            - That in my understanding is the biggest issue of our country

            - What is the strength of India? The youth

            - What is youth like you with strong passion doing? Putting so much hard work, effort,
              time and money still having least probability to be able to contribute for the country

            - So the remaining students either they apply for another government exam or settle for 
              a 20-30k private job

            - Forget about contributing to the nation we’re not even able to contribute to the family

            - Youth’s energy is getting wasted

        - In India, today we have 2 armies: 1 who is standing at the border, another who’s 
          protecting country from the inside from external threats

        - The government is actively wanting people who can protect the country at that level too

        - For e.g. why has America grown in the past 15 years - Because of technology

        - Lets say you have 2 options

            1. You can put your efforts where lakhs of people are capable of contributing in 1 way,
               that is Railways, UPSC, etc

            2. Another is you can help the country grow where there is lack of skilled people to
               protect the country
               
        - **Where do you think you can contribute more?**`}
