      - Ecosystem we are setting over here is entirely different
          - This ecosystem and competition triggers them to do things
          - If they build a website in just a month and post in it their friends group, they will get a good recognition that increases their confidence and gives a lot of motivation.
          - I have shared examples of few learners who are building websites and sharing in their friend's group right. They are getting recognition for their work and also children are gaining confidence. This will also increase their motivation.
          - Even if motivation goes up & down,
              - They'll be triggered by others' progrees (Building projects, competitions etc.)
              - We will be sharing weekly reports with student and parent as well
      - Personal Care 4.0 (only 50 members per batch)
          - One major reason for losing motivation - not able to find out where they are missing
          - Micro level assessment - can understand where he is missing and guide/support/mentor him accordingly
      - Mindset trainings helps student to stay focused and motivated`}
