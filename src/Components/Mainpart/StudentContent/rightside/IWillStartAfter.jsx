- **Acknowledge**
    1. Yes, chala mandhi students ilaney anukuntaru, there is nothing wrong. Idhi common thing ae chala
       mandhi students ae cheptuntaru ila
    2. But memu chala mandhi students and parents ni guide chesina experience tho neku konni insights 
       share cheskuntanu. 
    3. Firstly, nuvvu enduku ippat nunde kadu antunnav? **<Listen to their answer carefully>**
    
    - **I am doing internship now, will join after the internship is finished**

        - Good to hear that you are doing internship at this stage, what is the company name? how much 
          stipend company is paying?
        - Check if student is doing paid internship or does student paying for internship
        - if student is not doing paid internship, explain what is an internship and why any company 
          would offfer internship and explain benfits of doing paid internship
        - if internship is not paid, it is not internship, it is a training
        - Make student realise that taking training for a few months will not help him to place with 
          a high paying job.

        - **Continue with conversation 1**

    - **Already joined in some other training program, will join in NxtWave once this program is 
        finished**

        - It’s really surprising that you started learning already, there are very few students like 
          you. what is the coaching center you joined? is it free or paid? what are you learning there?
           what is the training duration?
        - yela avutundi training? enni projects chesavu? mari ila coaching tesukunte niku akkada 1 lakh 
          per month salary job ippistara?
        - Nuv NxtWave eppudina join avvachu just money pay cheste chalu ani anukuntunnavu, kani nxtwave 
          lo admission only selection basis lo vastundi, <explain again about selection> nxt batch nunchi 
          manam national wide exam pettali ani plan chestunnam, after exam there will interview, if you
          get selected then only you are allowed to join in the program and fee hike kuda untundi 
          nxt batch ki.

        - **Continue with conversation 1**

    - **I will join in the 2nd year**

        - **I will get good grades in 1st year, from 2nd year onwards I will focus on skill development**

            - Why do you want to get good grades in 1st year?
            - Why do you think having good grades is important to get high paying job?

                - Reemphasie on path A  and make sure student understands what is the difference between
                 getting
                 3 LPA job and 12 LPA job

            - now tell me what is important to get high paying job? is it good grades or projects, paid 
              internships etc..

        - **Ippude kada engineering lo join iyindi, konchem college lo anta set chesukuni 2nd year lo 
        nxtwave lo
            join avutanu**

            - yes, chala mandi student ni laga feel avutaru, this is common, I just wanted to understand
             1st year
              lo college lo anta set chesukovali ani cheptunnav kada, em set chesukovali ani clear ga 
              okasari cheptava?

                - naku college lo konchem ekkuva time pettali emo teliyadu kada, ekkuva work istaru emo
                 or subjects
                  tough ga untay emo

            - Explain conversation 1 & reemphasize on Path A is the solution

            - Ask student to spend 4hrs (Training + Practice) per week minimum to get high paying job

                - when will you come home/hostel after college?
                - what do you do after reaching home? how much time you spend to finish your home work?
                - how many hours you spend on using your smartphone? do you really think you don’t have
                 4hrs time 
                  per week to secure your future?
                - if you really don’t have 4hrs time per week, initially you can spend less than 4hrs 
                then you can
                  eventually increase spending time in our program
                - if not realised, arrange user interaction with the same college student who is 
                learning with us 
                  and make student realise that learning 4hrs per week is doable.
