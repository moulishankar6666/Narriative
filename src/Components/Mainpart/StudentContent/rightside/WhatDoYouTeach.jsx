    1. Simply put, a Full Stack Developer is someone who builds apps and websites. Right now, we use many
       apps and websites on our mobile devices.

    2. In our program, you will also build many websites (such as Netflix, App Store, Wikipedia, 
       IPL Dashboards, and more).
       
    3. In Full Stack, we specialize in MERN stack, which is currently in high demand.
