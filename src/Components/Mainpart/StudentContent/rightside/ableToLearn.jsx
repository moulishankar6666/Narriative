    - 10th class maths is sufficient, 6 GPA in maths is more than enough

    - Weâ€™ll teach reverse engineered curriculum from zero level (explain how it works)

    - Transformation Stories
        - 15 backlogs person getting placed with our trainings
        - 30 interviews rejected person getting placed with our trainings

    - Only thing they need to do is to spend time & learn consistently

    - Personal care 4.0
        - Our platform will understand where they're progressing, where they're facing difficulty
        - And will generate weekly report on what they should do differently
        - It will be shared with parents as well`}

      <h3> Will my child be able to learn (Motivation)?</h3>

        {`
        - Ecosystem we are setting over here is entirely different - This
        ecosystem and competition triggers them to do things - If they build a
        website in just a month and post in it their friends group, they will
        get a good recognition that increases their confidence and gives a lot
        of motivation.
         - I have shared examples of few learners who are building
        websites and sharing in their friend's group right. They are getting
        recognition for their work and also children are gaining confidence.
        
        This will also increase their motivation. - Even if motivation goes up &
        down, - They'll be triggered by others' progrees (Building projects,
        competitions etc.) - We will be sharing weekly reports with student and
        parent as well - Personal Care 4.0 (only 50 members per batch) - One
        major reason for losing motivation - not able to find out where they are
        missing - Micro level assessment - can understand where he is missing
        and guide/support/mentor him accordingly - Mindset trainings helps
        student to stay focused and motivated`}
